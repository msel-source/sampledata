# sampledata

Sample MEF 3.0 data can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/334r3ldwqe989ec/AADFjs9GcxhEpf3SwWIE75SVa?dl=0) (dropbox link).

This data is approximately 300 MB, and represents 4 channels of actual canine intracranial EEG recorded at 250 Hz.  The data were recorded over a 36 hour period, from mid 9 August 2018 though 10 August 2018.  There is over 28 hours of actual data in this recording.

This data is intended to be a representative sample, and it includes multiple segments, and discontinuities which are from real-world issues like telemetry dropouts and battery recharging.

This data was recorded using the [meflib](https://github.com/msel-source/meflib) and [mefwriter](https://github.com/msel-source/mefwriter) code repositories.
