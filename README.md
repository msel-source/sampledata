Sample MEF 3.0 data can be found in this github repository, or [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/h6rhcv09ufrl7rq/sample_data.mefd.tar?dl=0) (dropbox link).

This dataset is contains four EEG time-series data channels in MEF 3.0 format.  The files are unencrypted.  The dataset is a two-hour segment of 256 Hz samples.  It also contains a record (annotation) file which contain two text notes.

The data were converted to MEF 3.0 using the [meflib](https://github.com/msel-source/meflib) and [mefwriter](https://github.com/msel-source/mefwriter) code repositories.

(This repository updated September 2021, replacing a previous dataset with this one).

Below is a screenshot of what the first ~30 seconds looks like when plotted.  (note the timestamp is shown as GMT -7, or Pacific daylight time)
